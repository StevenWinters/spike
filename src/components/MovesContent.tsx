      <h2>Moves You Need to Know When Playing Volleyball:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Attack
          <p>
            Attack is, and continually has been, the alfa and omega of
            volleyball. You can't win without assault. Attack brings groups
            maximum of the factors so we frequently consciousness it in
            practices. During attacking, we use our maximal leap and energy to
            hit the ball, we attempt to spike subsequent to the block, over the
            block or to apply the block to win a factor.
            <br />
            <br />
            In assault, it's no longer best energy and energy, every now and
            then we use technical hits, recommendations at the back of the
            block, powertips. Some units aren't ideal and to make a factor out
            of them may be very difficult. We additionally distinguish assaults
            after top and terrible set. Fast balls, transition balls to sides,
            pipe to the spiker, units for center blockers, backrow assault for
            the opposite. A big position additionally performs the offensive
            approach of the team, man or woman skills of man or woman attackers.
            Attack is really our largest weapon however it takes some time to
            grow to be a fantastic attacker

        <li>
          Block
          <p>
            Block is likewise a huge weapon which brings us points. In block, we
            want to be calm with a properly timed bounce and palms as some
            distance as viable over the internet to cowl the courtroom docket as
            a great deal as viable. We bounce from a standstill or brief stay
            away from to dam. The precedence purpose of the block is to dam our
            opponent directly to the ground. However, we additionally use the
            block to slower the incoming ball or to make the attacker spike
            subsequent to the block. Specialists in blockading are center
            blockers who're the maximum concerned ones in blockading. We could
            have an person block while we block alone. Or we set double, triple
            block and assist center blockers block the attacking center blocker
            or pipe. Block is part of shielding play collectively with
            protection withinside the subject. We can't block the whole lot so
            the cooperation with protection withinside the subject is important.
            Similar to attack, block isn't always an clean talent either. We are
            continuously withinside the air and we've got exceedingly little
            time to be successful.

        <li>
          Serve
          <p>
            We are given to serve. For an extended time, provider handiest
            served as an initiation of a rally. Recently, the position of serve
            has modified from easy setting the ball to play to instant advent of
            strain at the opponent. In cutting-edge volleyball, it's far the
            primary assault of the crew. However, serve isn't handiest
            approximately power, we are able to use glide serve with soar or
            from the ground. We generally pick out the route of our serve to the
            weakest receiver of the alternative crew or among spikers. We also
            can use quick serve, technical to a sure zone. Sometimes we strive
            to make the receiver acquire with overhead hit or we serve to sure
            aspect from the receiver. The purpose of serve is to make the
            assault of the opponent as lots hard as possible, be it an ace or an
            erroneous reception. Serve is a large weapon, collectively with
            assault and block, it brings us factors and factors matter.

        </li>
        <li>
          Set
          <p>
            We get to set almost after every serve reception or defense in the
            field. We can do a jump set, if I'm the setter, or we can set from
            the ground in case of other players. There is always a specialist
            for set in a team, the setter, who has the best setting technique.
            The setter sets mainly with overhead hit but they can also use
            bagher if they have to chase the ball or the ball is too low to use
            the overhead hit. The setter sets to all attacking players, he must
            be able to set to sides to spikers, quick sets to middle blockers
            and back sets to opposites. The setter touches the ball the most and
            is the brain of the team on which the performance and result of the
            team depend a lot. The goal of the set is to set the ball to
            attacking players to the perfect position so that they can attack in
            various ways.

        <li>
          Defense in the Field
          <p>
            Together with block, defense in the field is a part of defense. In
            the field, we defend in bent position, ready to dig any ball coming
            from the opponent. Defense in the field doesn't bring direct points
            but avoids opponents' direct points in case of defending an attack.
            At the same time, it gives us the possibility of a counter attack.
            The biggest specialist in defense in the field is libero but other
            players have to do it too. In the field, we play the defense in our
            zones according to our positions. We use bagher, overhead hit, dive
            or different part of the body if a hard spike is coming to us. We
            need to have a good defense in the field to succeed as a team.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Reception
          <p>
            Last, but equally important as the others, is reception. Reception
            comes after opponent's serve. In reception, we stay in the court in
            bent position, we want to pass the opponent serve to the net.
            Reception is similar to defense in the field, our goal is not to
            suffer a point and to put the ball high as good as possible for the
            setter. Specialists in reception are spikers and libero. We usually
            receive with bagher or overhead hit. In reception, we expect that a
            spike or float serve will fly to us. Reception is never only about
            one player. Always receive at least two players in case of the float
            serve, three or four players in case of the jump serve. As I
            mentioned at the beginning of the video, volleyball is not an easy
            sport. In every skill, you need to master various subskills,
            different variations, individual technique.
            <br />
            <br />
            At the end, it's necessary to combine everything well in a common
            work in the team to perform at our bests in a game or a practice.
            Also, don't forget that you can keep improving all skills and
            becoming better players.
